Test-driven data analysis (TDDA) is a methodology that applies the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) to the field of data analysis. 

The goal of TDDA is to ensure that data analysis is conducted in a rigorous, systematic, and reproducible manner.

In TDDA, the analysis process is broken down into small, testable units. Each unit is tested against a set of predefined criteria, which are derived from the analysis objectives and data quality requirements. The tests are automated, so that they can be run repeatedly as the analysis progresses.

TDDA emphasizes the importance of data quality and reliability, and provides a structured framework for assessing and improving these aspects of the analysis. By following TDDA principles, data analysts can ensure that their analyses are trustworthy and accurate, and that the results are robust and reproducible.
