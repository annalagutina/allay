There are several reasons why Test-Driven Data Analysis (TDDA) is not as popular as Test-Driven Development (TDD):

**TDDA requires specialized skills:** TDDA requires a deep understanding of statistics, data modeling, and data analysis tools. This makes it harder for developers who lack these skills to apply TDDA to their work.

**TDDA is a relatively new concept:** While TDD has been around for decades, TDDA is a relatively new concept that is still gaining traction. As a result, there are fewer resources available for learning and applying TDDA than there are for TDD.

**Data analysis tools do not always support TDDA:** Many data analysis tools do not have built-in support for writing tests, making it difficult to apply TDDA to data analysis.

**Data analysis is not always straightforward:** Data analysis can be more complex and varied than software development, and it can be difficult to define tests that cover all possible scenarios. This makes it harder to apply TDDA to data analysis.

Overall, TDDA faces challenges related to the complexity of data analysis, the need for specialized skills, the lack of tool support, and the relative newness of the concept. 

However, as data becomes more central to software development and other fields, TDDA is likely to become more popular and widely adopted.
