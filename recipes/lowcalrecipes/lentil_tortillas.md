# Lentil tortillas (vegan)
Three-ingredient low-cal lentil flatbread is gluten-free, cooked without oil and animal products, but is soft and very satiating.

## Ingredients
* 200 gr red lentils
* 500 ml water
* (optional)  ½ teaspoon salt (or more if you like them salty) and any spices you like

## Cooking
Rinse the lentils, dry them, and pour water over them for 6-10 hours (I usually let them stay overnight). 
Pour in the salt and spices. Do not drain the water. Grind everything with a blender until smooth.
Heat a non-stick pan well. Pour 3-4 tablespoons of batter into it, spreading it evenly with a spoon.
Cook for 1-1½ minutes, then flip and fry for another 1 minute. Cook the rest of the tortillas in the same way.


Tortillas (flatbread) are a great substitute for bread, go well with hummus, cheese, creem cheese, butter. You can experiment with toppings.
