# Low-cal pancakes
These blini are more like pancakes.
You will need a non-stick pan or electric grill as there will be no butter.

## Ingredients
 * 3 eggs
 * Â½ teaspoon salt
 * Â½ teaspoon of soda
 * Â½ tablespoon of stevia
 * 80 g flour
 * 80 g Baking Protein
 * 500 g of kefir

## Cooking
 Whisk together the eggs, salt and soda. Mix flour and Baking Protein together. Add half of the sifted flour and protein mix and 250 g of kefir and mix thoroughly.  Add the remaining flour and protein mix and kefir and mix again until smooth.  Let the dough sit for 15 minutes.

 Heat the pan or grill well. Spread a thin layer of dough over it and fry over medium heat until golden brown on both sides.

You can serve pancakes with any topping: jam, cheese, ham, berries, honey or whatever you want in a moment. They are tasty without toppings as well: e.g. you can serve them as bread.
