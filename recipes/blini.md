# Thin and very tender pancakes

## Ingredients
 * 3 eggs
 * Â½ teaspoon salt
 * Â½ teaspoon of soda
 * 1 tablespoon of sugar
 * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil + for greasing
 * 160 g flour
 * 500 g of kefir

## Cooking
 Whisk together the eggs, salt, soda and sugar.  Add butter, half of the sifted flour and 250 g of kefir and mix thoroughly.  Add the remaining flour and kefir and mix again until smooth.  Let the dough sit for 15 minutes.

 Grease a frying pan with oil and heat well. Spread a thin layer of dough over it and fry over medium heat until golden brown on both sides.

 From time to time the pan should be re-greased with oil.

You can serve pancakes with any topping: jam, cheese, ham, berries, honey or whatever you want in a moment. They are tasty without toppings as well.
